    "Problem Statement": "You are given a list of integers. Your task is to implement a python function that returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. The function should take the input list and return the sum of all the even numbers in it.",
    "Input Format": "A single list lst of integers.",
    "Output Format": "The sum of all the even numbers in the input list.",
